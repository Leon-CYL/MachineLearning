# Machine Learning(Coursera)

## Description:

> This course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

## Course Overview:

### Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

> In the first week of the course, it starts by introducing different types of machine learning(supervised VS unsupervised) that people use in different situation. In addition, this week teaches the very basic linear regression algorithm(cost function, learning rate and gradient descent).

### Week 2: Regression with multiple input variables

> In the second week of the course, it dives deeper into Linear Regression with multiple input variables by introducing using numpy array to efficiently do the dot product between them and Gradient Descent with multiple input variables. Moreover, it introduces Polynomial Regression Learning and feature engineering to fit curves with non-linear functions to the data.
