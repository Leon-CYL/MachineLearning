# Machine Learning(Coursera)

## Description:

> This course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

## Course Overview:

### Week 1:

> In the first week of the course, it starts from introducing different types of machine learning like linear regression and linear classification that people used in different situation. In addition, this week teach the very basic linear regression algorithm(cost function, learning rate and gradient descent).

### Week 2:
